# The-Role-of-Guest-Sentiment-on-Airbnb-Pricing-along-Ireland-s-Wild-Atlantic-Way
This research explored the determinants of Airbnb pricing in rural and coastal tourism regions, focusing on Irelandâ€™s Wild Atlantic Way. By combining structured property-level data with unstructured guest reviews, I applied advanced natural language processing (BERT and RoBERTa) and machine learning models (XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest) to evaluate the predictive power of sentiment in price modeling. The study revealed that structural features such as property capacity remain primary price drivers, while guest sentiment provides additional explanatory value. The work contributes to tourism analytics by extending hedonic pricing models with reputation-based signals, offering actionable insights for hosts, policymakers, and regional planners.
